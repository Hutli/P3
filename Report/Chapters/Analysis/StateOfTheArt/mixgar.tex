Mixgar utilizes the users' Facebook likes to find out what artists and genres the users like. With this data, a playlist made from Youtube's database is created for the party, where people can up- or downvote songs.\\

The system accumulates data about the party's mood curve, the progression of songs that are played, and can automatically arrange songs in the playlist if the administrator chooses to switch to what they call autopilot mode.
The administrator can choose to skip songs, remove them from the playlist or restrict the genres that are allowed to be played.
