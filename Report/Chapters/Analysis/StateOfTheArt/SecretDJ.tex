SecretDJ gives its users the ability to see which venues use the SecretDJ system, and which are nearest to the user. The users can add songs to the venue's playlist and give likes, via Facebook, to the songs, moving them up the playlist.\\

A new user can add four songs to a venue's playlist each day. If a user gets a lot of likes for the songs he has added to a venue's playlist, the user can rise in rank for that venue, which means the user can add more songs to that venue's playlist and that his choices are moved further up the playlist by default. 
If a user gets enough likes and is active enough, the user can rise to the rank of DJ for a venue, meaning that the user's choice of songs will always be next in line, and there is no limit to the amount of songs the user can add to the playlist.
