Rockbot is a service where brands and enterprises can create venues at their locations. People who are at the location of these venues can vote on songs from a predetermined playlist and see what is playing and will be played. The system uses GPS data to find the users position and find out what venues the user are able to check in at \cite{rockbotFeatures}.

All users can add songs to the playlists from the approved library but when their song is played is affected by their DJ level. This level is decided from the users activity over a 120 day period. Their activity is decided from number of picks made, number of check-ins and number of likes \cite{rockbotBlog}.
