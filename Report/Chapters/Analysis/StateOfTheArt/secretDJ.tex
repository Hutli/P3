SecretDJ \cite{secretDJ} is a mobile app that enables you choose the tunes that play in bars and pubs. The app gives its users the ability to see which venues use the SecretDJ system, and which are nearest to the user. The users can add songs to the venue's playlist and give likes, via Facebook, to the songs, moving them up the playlist.

A new user can add four songs to a venue's playlist each day. If a user gets a lot of likes for the songs he has added to a venue's playlist, the user can rise in rank for that venue, which means the user can add more songs to that venue's playlist and that his choices are moved further up the playlist by default.

If a user gets enough likes and is active enough, the user can rise to the rank of DJ for a venue, meaning that the user's choice of songs will always be next in line, and there is no limit to the amount of songs the DJ can add to the playlist.

A concept of having a master service to give the users an overview over what songs are playing and will be played at multiple venues near the user, which is benificial for user if the user is scouting for a bar with his music preferences. The system intergrates a social media for voting on song, this concept could be discouraging to some users if the user didnt want to share ones music preferences. The user has the ablities to add and vote on songs on the playlist, adding song to the playlist is limited by a daily number of entries, determined by a level system based on the number likes the songs he added to playlist, got by other users of the system. A concept of one user becoming a dj, hence the name SecretDJ, is achievable by being the most active and liked user at the venue, which gives the power of unlimited adding to the playlist and all the DJ's song is next in queue, this could cause potential problem in that other users songs are neglected until the DJ leaves the venue, making it hard anybody else to progress in thier level.
