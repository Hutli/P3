This project involves the interaction at social venues and how people can interact and have influence on what the music that is played at the venue. As presented in the introduction most venues currently rely on a centralized human interaction with the people serving at the venues, for instance bartenders or waiters, to be the ones taking requests from costumers and combining this with the venues interests to decide what music is to be played. As already mentioned this is not optimal since this is not his or her primary function. This can result in people not getting the desired influence or the waiter/bartender to complete his or her primary task unsatisfying.

When working with user interaction there are two main considerations. How the user recives data (input) and how the user influences the system (output).
Currently the user can interact with the system via a centralized system where all users can interact at one or few interaction points. The alternative is a decentralized interaction point system where each user can interact with the system via individual interaction points.
The same two possibilities goes for the input to the user. Meaning that the input, the user being able to see the result of his or her interaction, can either be centralized combining the interaction from all the users in one place and displaying it there or decentralized, showing the result for his or her interaction and possibly the combined interaction from all too.

Furthermore both the input and output interaction points can be combined meaning that the system could either have a completely centralized interaction point or completely decentralized interaction points enabling the users to both interact with the system and recieve conformation at the same point.
