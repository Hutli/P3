\subsection{Music Requests}

When bargoers want to request a desired track, the common way is to ask the bartender or the currently playing DJ. The process of communicating the request to the person in charge of the music, is typically tedious due to volume of other bargoers and the playing music. All DJs are biased towards their own music preferences or not considering the request made at all. For the bartenders taking in request means less focus on serving drinks, which in turn results in queues, specifically during periods of stress, which is not desireable for either party. The bar is sells less beverages~\cite{Queues gives lower income}, and bargoers spend more time in queue which is tiring and not a very social activity~\cite{Queues er tr√¶ls}.
