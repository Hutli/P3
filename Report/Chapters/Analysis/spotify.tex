\subsection{Spotify}
\label{sub:spotify}
Spotify was chosen as the platform from which the system would acquire its music data, because 3 of the bars that were interviewed in \cref{interviews}, uses spotify for controlling their music doing daytime. Spotify is also a well-established platform for streaming music with over 20 million songs. 
 Spotify provides a API (Application Programming Interface) that allows the programmer to develops applications that can access and manage data from spotifys servers.
Although it is only allowed to use spotify as an publicly availible system in Sweden \cref{source}, this means the project group does not have to deal with licensing and a hosting of music data for the system.
