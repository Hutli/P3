\subsection{Spotify}
\label{sub:spotify}
Spotify was chosen as the service from which the system would acquire its music data. This was done because a majority of the bars that were interviewed in \cref{interviews}, uses spotify for controlling their music during daytime. Spotify is also a well-established service for streaming music with over 20 million tracks.

Spotify provides a API that allows the programmer to develop applications that can access and manage data from spotifyâ€™s servers. This means the project group does not have to deal with licensing and a hosting of music data for the system.

Spotify also provides a business plan that allows for playing music to the public. Spotify Business is only available in Sweden right now~\cite{spotifyBusiness}.
