It is Friday afternoon and Camilla is planning to meet some of her fellow students at a bar. Camilla and her friends get together after they are finished at school and go to a café to grab a sandwich. After dinner, Camilla takes out her smartphone and checks openPlaylist. Camilla can see that some of her favourite tracks are being played at White Hart, and they agree to go there. Upon arriving Camilla checks in via the application. She immediately notices on the screen behind the bar that the queue is filled with tracks she dislikes. She now uses the application to request and upvote other tracks that she would like to be played. Some other people at White Hart agree on Camilla's choices and they too upvote these tracks. On the screen in the bar Camilla can see some of the other people that upvotes her tracks and later in the evening she meets them and they talk about all the nice music they have in common. Camilla and her new and old friends party all night long and drink a lot of beer. \jenote{Godt nok sprog? Det kan måske lige gøres lidt mere professionelt}
