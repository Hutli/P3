When designing an interactive system, it is important to think about the people using it. The people are a part of the interactive system and therefore it is important to make sure that the design fits the people. In~\citetitle{benyon2013designing}, PACT analysis is presented as a framework for thinking about design situations. To help with the design being human centred, the designer needs to understand the four parts of the analysis: It is important to understand the different kinds of people using the system, since they have different prerequisites for using a system. The activities that people want to undertake are equally important, as it says a lot about the way the system will be used. The designer needs to think about the context, the location and organisation, the system will be used in, which provides information about how the system should operate. Lastly the designer should consider the features of interactive technologies and how to incorporate them in the design.

\end{figure}

It is also important to understand the relationship between activities and technologies. \Cref{fig:pact-overview} shows how the activities that people are doing will influence the requirements for technologies. This will create new technology that will change the activities that people will be doing with the technology.

It is the variety of the requirements that are found during the PACT analysis, that can make designing systems difficult. Therefore, an analysis of the four core elements of PACT will be conducted.


\subsection{People}
\label{sub:pact_people}

The system is used by people who go to bar-like environments, and are possibly intoxicated. At bar-like environments, music is central to the atmosphere, and a lot of people are interested in having their music tastes accommodated. Different people exhibit different behaviour in these social contexts, some may clique together when using a social system and some may be afraid of stigmas when using it.

\subsection{Activities}
\label{sub:pact_activities}
Usage of the system requires the user to interact with their smartphone or similar device. Firstly the user must install the application on their device. The installation process should not take a long time, or else the user might forget about the application. When the user is checked-in, the current playlist of the venue will be displayed. From the playlist screen the user can vote on a track. Finding which track to vote for should not be a complex action, as this is expected to be a frequent action.

\paragraph{New or improved activities}
The system introduces a possibility of requesting a track to be played at the venue, without having to ask the administrator. This eases the work load on the administrator, who might be busy serving beverages to a customer. It also eases the process of requesting a track by not having to go to the counter, which may lead to more time spent together with one's company. The system might change the behaviour of the users and serve as topic of discussion, possibly an icebreaker. These changes in activities should be considered when designing the system.

\subsection{Context}
\label{sub:pact_context}
The system will most likely be used in a dark environment with a lot of noise as is common in bars/pubs. The environment most likely involves a lot of movement, such as people dancing. As stated in the interviews in \cref{userInterviews}, usage of smartphones in these kind of environments often causes anti-social behaviour, which is typically not desired in a social setting.

\subsection{Technologies}
\label{sub:pact_technologies}

The system runs on a host computer with an audio system connected and with access to a music catalogue. This host computer is located at the installation site.

For users to operate this system, a smartphone with internet connection and adequate battery life is required. When designing the system, different smartphones and their characteristics have to be considered.

\subsection{Summary}
\label{sec:pact_summary}

The people using the system are possibly intoxicated, and most likely in the context of meeting and talking to other people. It is often considered rude and anti-social to neglect the people you are with, by using a smartphone. In order to minimise this behaviour, the system must be \textit{quick}\footnote{Frequent and determined users might access the system often with a already known task for the system, making them capable of interacting with the system without hesitation. The system should not be the limiting factor in this process.} and \textit{easy to navigate and use}, by providing a small and effective set of functionalities.
Power consumption on the mobile devices is of concern, as smartphones drain their batteries quicker when in active use. Therefore a requirement of the system is to \textit{minimise power consumption}, by not doing extensive computing on the clients side.


The PACT analysis provides us with the following requirements
\begin{itemize}
  \item The client should be quick
  \item Easy to use and navigate - Few but effective functionalities
  \item Minimal computation on the client
\end{itemize}
