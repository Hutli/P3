Adam has just begun his night shift in the bar. Usually Adam would have to manage the bars music system, as well as tend the bar, until the DJ arrives, but not tonight. The bar has just yesterday implemented openPlaylist. Now, when people come up to Adam to request tracks, he can just tell them about the openPlaylist app. With Adam not having to manage the music system manually, the queue to the bar has never been shorter.
