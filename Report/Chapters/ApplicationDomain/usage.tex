\subsection{Actors}
There are two actors of this system; an administrator which could be a
bartender or a bar owner in charge of the music, and a guest wanting
to request and affect the music being played at the venue. Further information about these actors are presented in the below tables for respectively administrators and guests. Based on these actors, actor tables and usage diagrams has been made, see \cref{tab:actorTable,fig:UsageAdmin,fig:UsageUser}. These describe the possible actions each actor can take in the system.

\actortable{Administrator}{
    \textbf{Purpose:} A person that protects the interests of the venue and is responsible for the music. He or she wants to be able to have control over the system, what kind and in which order music is being enqueued and what is currently playing.

    \textbf{Characteristics:} Has a preference or a theme of music that the individual is following, set by the organisation or the individual itself. Works at the venue and has a reasonable high technical level or the ability and motivation to be taught the use of the system.

    \textbf{Possible usage:} Administrator 1 is very open minded for all requests and votes from users and only sets the bare minimum restrictions to maintain the theme of the venue.

		Administrator 2 completely controls the playlist by adding, removing and rearranging tracks to completely fit the venue's preferences and what is played. He is very restrictive and only accepts requests and votes that he agrees with.

		Add and remove restrictions, play, pause and stop music, play next track and add, remove and rearrange tracks on the playlist.\\\\

\actortable{Guest}{
    \textbf{Purpose:} Wants to influence the playlist and listen to preferred tracks at a venue.

    \textbf{Characteristics:} Has a music preference possibly different from the administrator and/or the specific theme at the specific venue. Varying technical level but with the ability to use his or her smartphone.

    \textbf{Possible usage:} Guest 1 only requests tracks to the playlist but rarely votes on other users tracks.

		Guest 2 only votes on tracks and does not use the feature of requesting tracks.

		A user has the ability to check in and out of a venue, vote and revote for track and cancel their vote.\\\\
