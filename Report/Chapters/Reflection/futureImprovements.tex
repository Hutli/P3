\section{Future Improvements}
\label{future}

This section will describes some of the concepts, excluded from the scope of the project, but could be included in a future system, solving the same problem. 

\paragraph{Incorporate multiple music catalogues}
A music catalogue, like spotify used in this implementation, is not complete with all the music availible on earth. To expand the music availible to user, a collective music catalogue of several different music catalogue could be implemented. An important detail on this is that track might appear multiple times across these catalogues, to ensure that the same track in audio, does not have two instances on the playlist and common representation for the collective catalogue is required.

\paragraph{Gather and utilise data about checked in users}
The system could implement collecting statistics about the individual users votes, to give the user recommendation specificly directed at them.

To further decrease time spend on interaction with the system, the users music related likes and favorites on social medias(soundcloud, facebook..) could be used to generate playlist from this info. This introduce a kind of passive interaction, between the user and the system, the user is affecting what is being queued to be played indirectly. This might be more fitting for a complete app for the venue also including other features as cocktail/product menu system, advertising system..

\paragraph{Reward/progression}
A reward and/or progression system could be implemented to further encourage to the user to vote beside the the benefit of listening to track they want to. Maybe introducing a reward, either a beer at the venue or higher weight \footnote{a vote counts as two votes} in the system locally or globally, for each 20th track voted on. Such system would give the user a sense of progression, which has shown very beneficial in the industry of computer games \cite{games}, in keeping the user busy using the system. This might also contradict the aim of minimizing time spend using the system.
