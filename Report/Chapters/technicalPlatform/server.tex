\section{Backend server}
\label{techPlat:backendServer}

A backend server is required to communicate with clients. This section describes the technical decisions, and complementary argumentation regarding:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How to communicate between client and server
  \item How to output audio in the system
  \item Which component of the system should be responsible for searching
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication with Client}
The following events can occur on clients that will have to be
transmitted to the server for further processing.

\begin{itemize}
\item Check-in
\item Searching
\item Voting
\item Influence volume
\item Check-out
\end{itemize}

The following resources are available on the server, accessible from
clients.

\begin{itemize}
\item Playlist
\item History of last played tracks
\item Now playing track
\item Current volume level
\end{itemize}

These events and resources are all available for the client to access from the server
via HTTP endpoints. See \cref{imp:backendServer} for further elaboration.

\subsection{Playback of Music}
When receiving audio data streams from Spotify, some way of outputting the audio is needed. The data stream is of type Pulse Code Modulation (PCM). In searching for a way to playback PCM data it was found that NAudio\footnote{\url{https://naudio.codeplex.com/}} was the most sensible choice in terms of extensibility.

\subsection{Searching}
As the user has to be able search for music in order to request tracks, different ways of giving this ability to the user was possible. In deciding how to search for tracks, two possibilities were immediately apparent:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The client sends a search query to the backend server. The
    server fetches search results matching the query from Spotify's servers. These results are restricted against a chosen restriction. Lastly the restricted results are sent to the client.
  \item The backend server sends the restriction to the client and the client searches and applies the sent restriction.
\end{itemize}

It was choosing to let the backend server handle the search. This avoids the complexity of making sure that the clients always have an updated list of restrictions.
