\section{Music Catalogue}
\label{sec:Music_catalog}
To have a selection of music for the users to browse, a music catalog had to be chosen. Spotify was chosen as the service from which the system would acquire its music data. This was done because a majority of the bars interviewed in \cref{interviews}, uses Spotify for controlling their music during daytime. Spotify is also a well-established service for streaming music with over 20 million tracks.

Spotify provides an API that allows the programmer to develop applications that can access and manage data from Spotifyâ€™s servers. This means the project group does not have to deal with licensing and hosting of music data.

Spotify also provides a business plan that allows for playing music to the public. Spotify Business is only available in Sweden right now~\cite{spotifyBusiness}.
