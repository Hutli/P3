\chapter{Development Methodology}

Because the success of this project is not well defined, because picking which song to play next is a subjective decision, we choose to follow a interative process, setting a new milestone for each iteration. These milestones will consist of some features which we will analyse, design, implement and evaluate, documenting every step in the process. Ideas for various algorithms will be tested on multiple subjects, which we will interview for finding new possible problems or requirements, to be taken up for consideration under following iteration.
Clearly this project being very experimental, following a linear approach would require alot of possibly not previously researches knowledge, for making descriptive analysis and design documents before even being able to test our thesis'es on how to cope with a problem. Expected problems with the newly found solutions, would then not be handled with a new iteration.
