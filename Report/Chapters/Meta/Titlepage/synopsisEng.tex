\begin{center}This project focuses on the interaction between the guests and administrators at a venue, often a bar or a pub, with focus on music.
In interviews, it was found that this interaction is currently not a problem, since requesting and other music-related interaction is not a part of the experience, guests have when visiting venues. This project therefore focuses on analysing the context, environment and experience, the guests currently have at venues. It aims to find a way to extend this experience to also cover music, and integrate this into the experience and social environment. This will be done by shifting some of the control of music from the administrators to the guests, and enable guests to socially participate in the selection process, while still maintaining the interests of the venue. It is important to keep in mind, throughout the project, that the product should not limit the current experience the users have, by for instance distracting them.\\ \end{center}
