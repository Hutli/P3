\label{sub:problemStatement}
Guests at venues that plays music rarely have the chance to influence the music that is playing, without going through a lot of bother. Meanwhile, the administrators at the venues are often put in charge of controlling the music, and taking requests from the guests who are there. This means that the administrators often have to decide what music to play and what music not to play. This might disturb them in doing their other functions at the venue while also giving inevitable bias to the music that the administrator likes.
These problems have given rise to the following problem definition, which the system should try to answer

\begin{center}
\textit{How is it possible to develop a software solution which provides a venue with the ability to fairly and dynamically cater to their guests' music preferences?}
\end{center}

Furthermore, the system should take some subproblems into account:
\begin{itemize}
\item How can the system provide supervision and control to the administrators?
\item How can the system avoid undesirable music flow?
\end{itemize}
