This chapter aims to provide insight in the system of which this project is based around. The sections and structure of the chapter originates from~\citetitle{mathiassen2001objektorienteret} and includes some of the techniques from~\citetitle{benyon2013designing}. Some general concepts in the system are sought to be derived from the state of the art and how these concepts affects the system is explored further. Based on concepts described in \cref{StateOfTheArt}, a paper prototype of a mobile application is presented in \cref{paperPrototypeSystemChoice}. Conclusively, a specific system definition defines the system of which this project will revolve around.
