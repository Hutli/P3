\subsection{System Definition}
\label{sub:systemDefinition}
An information system enabling venues to have guests vote for tracks to be played. The system should enable the administrators to override the specific tracks and limit the track space the users can vote for, at any given time. The client should be minimalistic, so as to improve understandability and learnability, even for intoxicated users. The system should display already requested tracks to all customers, as to improve discoverability.
The administrative server has to be able to run on an inexpensive computer with a varying stability of internet access and access to a music catalogue. The client application has to run on smartphones with unstable internet access and limited data traffic and battery capacity.
