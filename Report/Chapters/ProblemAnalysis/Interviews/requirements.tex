\subsection{User Requirements}
\label{sub:user_requirements}

Based on the interviews with the potential users, some user requirements have been specified. The requirements are listed as small sections of text, describing the requirement and referring to the place in the interviews where the requirement is derived from.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The application should be as simple as possible.}\\
        It was found that people use their mobile phones too much when they were going out. This will be described further in \cref{sub:smartphone_usage}. It is not an intention to solve this problem, but more so to ensure that the problem does not escalate. By keeping the application simple it does not draw too much attention from the user.
    \item \textbf{The next song to be played at a venue should be influenced by guests at the venue.} \\
      Many of the interviewed users in \cref{userInterviews} liked the idea of guests controlling the music. When asked how much control should be given to the guests, some different ideas were presented. One idea was to freely be able to choose tracks, while another idea was to only let the guests choose the genre to be played.
\end{enumerate}
