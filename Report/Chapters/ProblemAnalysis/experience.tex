\section{Experience}
This project focus on the interaction between the guests and administrators at a venue, often bar or pub, with focus on music.
In the interviews it was found, that this interaction is currently not a problem, since requesting and music interaction is not a part of the experience, guests have when visiting venues. This project focuses therefore on analysing the context, environment and experience, the guests currently have at venues. It aims to find a way to extend this experience, to also cover music, and integrate this into the current experience and social environment. This will be done by shifting some of the control of music from the administrators to the guests, and enable users to socially participate in the selection process, while still maintaining the interests of the venue. It is though important to keep in consideration, throughout the protect, that the product, should not limit the current experience the users have, by for instance distracting them.
