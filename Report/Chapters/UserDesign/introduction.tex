This chapter is concerned with the user experience of the system, specifically the design of user interfaces.
The system has three interfaces, one for the administrator, the server interface, one for the guests, the client interface, and a common overview for both, the presentation interface. 
The presentation interface is for displaying the playlist, each track's votes, the currently playing track and the recently played tracks. 
The client interface is providing an overview, centred around the individual using the interface, and is also providing a way to interact with the system. 
The server interface is for administrative purposes, e.g. controlling restrictions, the playlist or music catalogue, but is also for a more general overview of the current state of the system e.g. connection to the music catalogue.
