In this chapter the design process for the project will be described. In the design process, original ideas and expansions on the concepts analysed in \cref{StateOfTheArt} will be further investigated and brought together in a complete design for a solution to the problem stated in the problem statement described in \cref{ProblemStatement}. The system has three interfaces, one for the administrator, one for the guests and a common overview for both. The interfaces share the purpose of providing output of the playlist's current state, with different levels of details. The presentation interface is for displaying the playlist, each track's votes, the currently playing track and the history of the playlist. The client interface is providing an overview centred around the individual using the interface and is also providing a way to interact with the system. The server interface is for administrative purposes e.g. controlling restrictions, playlist and music catalogue, but also for a more general overview of the current state of the system e.g. connection to the music catalogue.
