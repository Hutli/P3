In this chapter the design process for the project will be described. In the design process, original ideas and expansions on the concepts analysed in \cref{StateOfTheArt} will be further investigated and brought together in a complete design for a solution to the problem stated in the problem statement described in \cref{ProblemStatement}. The systems user interfaces consists of three individual parts, one for the administrator, one for the guests and a common overview for both. The interfaces share the purpose of providing output of the playlists current state, though with different levels of details. The presentation interface is for displaying a summed status of the playlist, each indivuals votes and the history of the playlist. The client interface is providing an overview centered around the individual using the interface and is also providing a way to interact with system. The server interface is for administrative purposes e.g. controlling restrictions, playlist and music catalog, but also for a more general overview of the current state of the system e.g. connection to music catalog.
