After interviewing one of the bars from the first set of interviews described in \cref{interviews}, an agreement between the project group and the owner of the bar \enquote{Fabrikken} was made. The owner was willing to test and provide feedback of the application developed in this project. Therefore, another meet-up was held with the owner of Fabrikken. It was demoed how it was possible to vote on a given track from the smartphone. In response to this demonstration, the owner suggested some additional functionality as listed below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item{The owner would like to access some administration interface on the mobile application, in such a way that it is possible to administer the playlist while standing guard at the door.}
    \item{The administration interface would have to have the ability to control the genres the customers are allowed to vote on.}
    \item{The owner would like a screen to show the status of the music
        playback. This could be current and last song played. The
        currently highest voted song could also be displayed.}
    \item{The owner would like time and date controlled restrictions
        for the playlist. For example that it is not possible to play
        the track
        \enquote{Merry Christmas} from the 26th of December to the 1st
      of December.}
    \item {The owner would like to have the drinks menu as a features in the application.}
    \item{The owner would like to show his offers and events in the application.}
\end{itemize}
