After interviewing one of the bars from the first set of interviews described in \cref{interviews}, an agreement between the project group and the owner of the bar \enquote{Fabrikken} was made. The owner was willing to test and provide feedback of the application developed in this project. Therefore, another meet-up was held with the owner of Fabrikken. It was demoed how it was possible to vote on a given track from the smartphone. In response to this demonstration, the owner suggested some additional functionality as listed below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item{The owner would like to access some administration interface on the mobile application, in such a way that it is possible to administer the playlist when standing guard at the door.}
	\item{The administration interface would have to have the ability to control the genres the customers are allowed to vote on.}
	\item{He would like a screen to show the some status of music. This could be current and last song played. The currently highest voted song sould be displayed.}
	\item{He would like time and date controled filter for the playlist.}
\end{itemize}

The owner where thinking that it primary will be the regular guest which will use the application mostly. Based on that he whould like a application only for Fabrikken. For the personalized application he also would like to include som no music relevant features that we wont fokus on. The features are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item {The owner would like to have the drinks menu as a features in the application.} 
	\item{The owner would like to show his offers and event in the application.}
