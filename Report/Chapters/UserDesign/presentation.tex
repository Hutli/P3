\section{Presentation Interface}
As first introduced in \cref{MDCI} the system should include a
presentation interface. The concept of this interface is to avoid
guests from accessing their devices, just to check the current
playlist configuration, and instead provide a quick and easily accessible overview for the guests of the system. By having a separated screen from the guests' devices, the system should reduce the amount of time guests spend using their devices, which was declared a problem best seen minimised, as concluded in \cref{sub:user_requirements}. The intention is to have the playlist on a screen above the bar, as visually envisioned in \cref{fig:PresentationInterface}. The screen should direct the guests' attention towards the bar, by making the playlist more accessible to the guest as the screen is bigger in size and always on, opposed to the small handheld device \cite{DEB}. It is important to stress that the screen should not be visually blockable by a person or other objects.

This is a part of the system which should always be visually
accessible to the guest, and therefore should also be visually
pleasing to look at, but still contain all the information needed by
the guest. An interesting problem to solve, is having to display each
individual's votes in an efficient way, without providing an overflow
of information, confusing the guest. One suggested solution is to have
the most distinguishing content to the left, with the reading
direction, and the least distinguishing content to the
right~\cite{material}.

\subsection{Layout}
In the presentation interface, a track's placement on the playlist is
placed on the left hand side, the title with artists in middle and the
amount of votes on the right hand side.

The idea behind the design of the presentation interface, see \cref{fig:presentation}, is that the user is looking at a screen, that is scrolling the playlist of the venue, where the vertical middle is the currently playing track. The list above is the history of th playlist in accending order from the middle according to number tracks since they were played. Below is the upcoming tracks of the playlist in descending order according number of votes each track has.

\subsection{Visualising Presence of Guests}

A concept for the presentation interface to implement is the ability
to be able to visually see which guests vote on which tracks. In order
to implement this, a way of depicting individual guests is
required. This can be done by each guest having some sort of ID,
through a login or similar. With a Facebook login or another social
network login, it would be possible to display profile pictures
on each track, accordingly to guests' current votes.

This concept
provides the user with a way of identifying one self, and
acknowledging one's current vote on the presentation interface,
without having to use the client to look up this information. This can
further reduce time spend on the client, by providing an alternative
method of gaining information about the current state of the
venue.

This concept of visualising guests by their profile pictures is not
implemented in this project due to the need for a login system.
