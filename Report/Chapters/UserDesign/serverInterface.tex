\section{Server interface}\label{sec:serverInterface}
Due to prioritisation, it was decided that the interface of the server was designed with functionality in mind rather than aesthetics and usability. This could possibly lower the understandability and learnability of the application. This was prioritised, since it will only be the administrators using this interface. They have the motivation to learn such an interface and possibly read a description, because it is their job. Furthermore, an optimal solution should limit the time spent on this interface to a bare minimum. Because of this, it was decided that time should not be put into the aesthetic design of the interface.
