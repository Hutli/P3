\section{Server interface}\label{sec:serverInterface}
Due to prioritisation is were chosen that the interface of the server were designed to only be functional. This could possibly lower the understandability and learnability of the application. Since it only will be the administrators using this interface and they have the motivation to learn such an interface and possibly read a description, because it is their job. Furthermore an optimal solution should limit the time spent on this interface to a bare minimum. Because of this it was decided that time should not be put into the aesthetic design of the interface.
