For the purpose of showing some functionality for potential users of the final solution, it was chosen to construct a vertical prototype of the smartphone application.

The prototype only implemented key functionality, leaving anything else undone. The purpose of this is to show a small set of complete functionality. The application was supposed to look like the paper prototype described in \cref{paper_prototype}. Some of the design functionality was not implemented or replaced with dummy button just to show the potential design.
