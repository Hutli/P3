\label{paper_prototype}
A good starting point when designing objects is to prototype the
designs. An easy and inexpensive method of prototyping is paper
prototyping. The following section presents these initial prototypes
to give an overview of how the final software could look like,
benefiting both the reader and the authors of this project.

One of the first screens presented to the user of the client
application is a check-in screen listing nearby venues using
openPlaylist. See \cref{fig:paper_prototype_check_in}. To select a
venue, one has to press the list item as seen in \cref{fig:paper_prototype_check_in_interaction}.

    \label{fig:paper_prototype_check_in_interaction}
  }
  \caption{Check-in screen and interaction with it}
\end{figure}


Once checked-in to a venue, the user is presented with the playlist of
the venue. See \cref{fig:paper_prototype_playlist}. It is now possible
to influence the playlist, i.e. up-vote a chosen track. This
interaction and the corresponding feedback from the system is showcased in
\cref{fig:paper_prototype_playlist_interaction,fig:paper_prototype_playlist_feedback}.

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \subfloat[Main screen presenting an interactive playlist.]{

  \subfloat[Interaction between the playlist and the user.]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.33\textwidth]{paperPrototypeVoteInteraction}

  \subfloat[Feedback from the application from a up-vote action.]{

    \label{fig:paper_prototype_playlist_feedback}
                  }
  \caption{Voting on a track already on the playlist.}
\end{figure}

If a track is not present on the playlist, it can be added in the
request screen as shown in
\cref{fig:paper_prototype_add_track,fig:paper_prototype_add_track_interaction,fig:paper_prototype_add_track_feedback}.
