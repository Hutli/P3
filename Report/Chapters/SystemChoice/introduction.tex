This chapter aims to provide insight in the system of which this project is based around. The analysis methods used originates from~\cite{mathiassen2001objektorienteret} and~\cite{benyon2013designing}. First the chapter derives the concepts in the system from the current State of the Art and what each of these means for the system. Then the chapter focus on the users of the system, though interviews and persona, and what their preferences are. In the end a specific system definition together with a specific problem definition concludes the chapter and defines the system of which this project will analyse.
