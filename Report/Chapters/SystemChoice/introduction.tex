This chapter aims to provide insight in the system of which this project is based around. The sections and structure of the chapter originates from~\cite{mathiassen2001objektorienteret} and includes some of the techniques from~\cite{benyon2013designing}. Some general concepts in the system are sought to be derived from the state of the art and what these concepts mean to the system is explored further. Conclusively, a specific system definition defines the system of which this project will revolve around.
