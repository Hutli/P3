This chapter aims to provide insight in the system of which this project is based around. The sections and structure of the chapter originates from~\cite{mathiassen2001objektorienteret} and includes some of the techniques from~\cite{benyon2013designing}. Firstly, the concepts in the system are sought to be derived from the state of the art and what these concepts mean to the system. Then focus will be on the users of the system and what their preferences are. Conclusively, a specific system definition, together with a specific problem statement defines the system of which this project will analyse.
