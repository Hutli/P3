\subsection{Systemdefinition}

An information system, capable of efficiently executing a music related intent, within boundaries of set by the bar, while remaining easily accessible even for slightly intoxicated users.  The system should be able to help bartenders keep track of what music the bargoers wants to listen to \chnote{and whether the requests on track is still relevant(is the user still on location?)}, and be fair in the progression of the music, argued by the history of previously played tracks, when a track was requested and how many bargoes has the same request. The system has to run on a cheap computer with a varying stability of internet access and a Spotify Premium license, and smartphones with varying internet access. The system should introduce a social interaction by displaying already requested tracks to all bargoers, suggesting a democratic environment at the bar, for bargoes to have an influence on, but also serve as an icebreaker for the visitors between.
