After interviewing one of the bars from the first set of interviews described in \cref{interviews}, an agreement between the project group and the owner of the bar \enquote{Fabrikken} was made. The owner was willing to test and provide feedback of the application developed in this project. Therefore, another meet-up was held with the owner of Fabrikken. It was demoed how it was possible to vote on a given track from the smartphone. In response to this demonstration, the owner suggested some additional functionality. The owner would like to access some administration interface on the mobile application, in such a way that it is possible to administer the playlist when standing guard at the door. This administration interface would have to have the ability to control the genres the guests are allowed to vote on.
