\section{Track Duplicates in Music Catalogue}
\label{sec:duplicates}
The same track can appear multiple times in the music catalogue, if multiple versions of the track, with different meta data, exist, e.g. the track \enquote{Dancing Queen} made by ABBA appears on the albums \enquote{ABBA Gold} and \enquote{Arrival}. This is a problem since it could create confusion for the user about which track to vote for.

One solution of this problem is to use additional identifiers of the
meta data associated with a track. Two tracks are most likely
identical if their titles, names of artists, their years of recording and
their recording codes are all equal. Additionally, tiny variations in
the meta data can be allowed. For example, if the difference of the duration of the
two tracks is within 10 seconds, and all the prior mentioned meta data
matches up, the two tracks are probably identical.
