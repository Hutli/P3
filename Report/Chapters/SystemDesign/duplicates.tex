\section{Track Duplicates in Music Catalogue}
\label{sec:duplicates}
The same track can appear multiple times in the music catalogue, if different versions with different meta data exist, e.g. the track \enquote{Dancing Queen} made by ABBA appears on the albums \enquote{ABBA Gold} and \enquote{Arrival}. This is a problem since it could create confusion for the user about which track to vote for.

To cope with some of these conflicts in related metadata, more identifiers are required. \jenote{ARBEJD HERFRA DIG MED TRELLOKORTET}
