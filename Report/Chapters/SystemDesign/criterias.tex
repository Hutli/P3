\subsection{Criterias}
\label{sub:criterias}

This section is an attempt to prioritise some criterias for the system development process, From the system definition \cref{sub:systemDefinition} some conditions can be withdrawn. First thing is that the system should be usable, in that it should be aware of the organisational, work related and technical enviroment. \chnote{bullshit tage lige fra bogen..}
Next the system should be very reliable, because the music should always be playing, and always only execute actions that is within what is expected of the system. It should always keep the flow of the music into account. As for security it is not a focus point of the system definition. But lastly this been on a mobile platform with many different platform to develop for the system should be flexible, with reusable components, this goes hand in hand with the system also being moveable,
