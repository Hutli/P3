\section{Criteria}
\label{sub:criterias}

This section is an attempt to prioritise criteria for the system
development process, in order to focus the work of this report. From
the system definition described in \cref{sub:systemDefinition}, some
conditions can be withdrawn. First thing is that the system should be
usable, i.e. it should be aware of the organisational, work related
and technical environment of the problem domain.

Next the system should be very reliable. Specifically, this means that
the music should always be playing, and always only execute actions
that is within what is expected of the system. It should always keep
the flow of the music into account. As for security it is not a focus
point of the system definition.

Because the system should be able to run on mobile platforms, it is
important that the system is flexible, with reusable components. This
also implies that the system should be movable. The complete criteria
table can be seen in \cref{criteriatable}.
