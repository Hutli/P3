It was decided to limit the product from taking care of security. Any countermeasures to abuse, will not be considered in the implementation. This results in any individual with knowledge of the workings of the systems, and the format of the requests made to server, can abuse the system and change data uncontrolled and unintended. As security of the system was not a main concern for the project, the issue was left untouched, but should defiantly be considered when implementing in a real context.
