The main concept behind this system is to make music selection more democratic, by allowing guests of venues to vote for tracks, while the administrator remains in full control, with the ability to make restrictions on what can be added to the playlist and to actively alter the playlist. This section will describe restrictions, interactions with guest and describe an algorithm that ensures that the music never stops, providing the system with continuous playback. It will also briefly touch the communicational security of the system.
