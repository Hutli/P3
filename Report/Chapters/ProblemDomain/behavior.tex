As candidates for events, these possible actions on classes are considered:
\begin{description}
\item[Submitting/Cancelling votes]
    When a user votes for a track, or cancels it. If the \textit{Track} that is voted for fits within the \textit{Restriction}, the\textit{Track}s vote count is changed and potentially its order in the \textit{Playlist}. The specific \textit{User}s vote is also changed.
\item[Checking in/out of venues]
    A \textit{User} checks in at a venue. This allows the user to vote for \textit{Track}s there.
\item[Searching for a track]
    When a \textit{User} is searching for a desired \textit{Track} in the catalogue of \textit{Track}s. The \textit{User} should receive relevant search results that fit within the \textit{Restriction}s.
\item[Adding/Removing a track from the \textit{Playlist}]
    If a \textit{User} has voted for a \textit{Track}, which is not on the \textit{Playlist}, or if a \textit{Track} only had one vote which has been cancelled.
\item[New track is playing]
    When a \textit{Track} has ended, due to it being skipped or reaching the end. This should affect the vote count of the \textit{Track}. If the \textit{Track}, a \textit{User} has voted for, is played, the \textit{User}s vote should be reset.
\item[Adding/Removing restrictions]
    When the administrator either adds or removes a \textit{Restriction} from the \textit{Playlist}. \textit{Track}s on the \textit{Playlist} that do not meet the \textit{Restriction}s should be removed. The \textit{User}s' votes should also be voided if it does not meet the \textit{Restriction}.
\end{description}


The following event table is used to describe what classes are involved in the immediate events of the problem domain

\begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
		\centering
    \textbf{Events} & User & Track & Playlist & Vote & Restriction \\ \hline
    (Re)vote & * & * & * & * &   \\ \hline
    User checks in at venue & * &   &   & * &   \\ \hline
    User leaves venue & * &   &   &   &   \\ \hline
    User is searching for a track & * &   &   &  & * \\ \hline
    Adding a new track to the playlist & * & * & * & * &   \\ \hline
    Remove track from the playlist & * & * & * & * &   \\ \hline
    A new track is playing & * & * & * & * &   \\ \hline
    Restriction added & * & * & * & * & * \\ \hline
    Restriction removed & * & * & * & * & * \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
		\caption{Event table for the problem domain}
		\label{eventtable}
\end{table}

In \cref{eventtable}, the different events in the problem domain and what objects are effected by these are mapped. From this, specific state diagrams can be created to illustrate how the objects are created, affected and terminated.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{StateDiagramUser.pdf}
  \caption{State diagram for the user}\label{fig:StateDiagramUser}
\end{figure}
In \cref{fig:StateDiagramUser} the state diagram for a user can be seen. The problem domain is the context of the venue, and a user can therefore only affect the problem domain, when he or she is present at the venue. This results in the creation of the user, when he or she enters, and the termination when he or she leaves. When present at the venue, the user can search for tracks and vote or revote for these.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{StateDiagramPlaylist.pdf}
  \caption{State diagram for the playlist}\label{fig:StateDiagramPlaylist}
\end{figure}
In figure \cref{fig:StateDiagramPlaylist} it can be seen that a playlist, is created when the venue opens, and terminated when it closes. To ensure that users can see what the next track will be, without the playlist changing in the last second, and giving the system the time needed to decide the track and change temporary votes to permanent votes, a lockdown is placed 10 seconds before the next track is played, where no user can change their vote. The playlist automatically plays the next track, and when it is not in a lockdown, users can change their votes as desired.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{StateDiagramTrack.pdf}
  \caption{State diagram for the track}\label{fig:StateDiagramTrack}
\end{figure}
As seen in figure \cref{fig:StateDiagramTrack}, a track is only modelled in the problem domain, when it has votes. This means that it will be created, when it receives its first vote. If votes are removed from the track, it can result in the track having 0 votes again, and will therefore be terminated. While active the track can receive and lose votes from any user, when he or she changes his or her vote. The track will also be terminated when it has been played.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{StateDiagramRestriction.pdf}
  \caption{State diagram for the restriction}\label{fig:StateDiagramRestriction}
\end{figure}
As shown in figure \cref{fig:StateDiagramRestriction}, a restriction can be created and deleted at any time. This can only be done by the administrator. A restriction only affect the users' searches when it is active. It can be toggled between active and inactive by the administrator or the system at any time.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pd_venueState.png}
  \caption{State diagram for the restriction}\label{fig:StateDiagramVenue}
\end{figure}
As shown in figure \cref{fig:StateDiagramVenue}, a venue is a simple class, it is created when it first opens and is terminated when it is shut down. A venue has only two states, active and inactive, meaning whether or not guests are allowed. A venue can edit its playlist, without changing state, and likewise add or remove restrictions.
