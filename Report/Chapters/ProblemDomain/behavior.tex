\noindent{As candidates for events, these possible actions on classes are considered:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Submitting/Cancelling votes:
    When a user votes for a track, or cancels it. If the \textbf{vote} fits within the \textbf{restrictions}, the voted for \textbf{track}s vote count is changed and potentially its order in the \textbf{playlist} class, the specific \textbf{costumer} vote is changed.
\item Checking in/out of venues:
    User checks in at the venue, one wants to vote at. This allows the user to \textbf{vote}.
\item Searching for a track:
    When a user is searching for a desired track in the repertoire/catalogue of tracks. The user should receive relevant search results that fit within the \textbf{restriction}s.
\item Adding/Removing a new track to the playlist:
    If the track a user voted for is not on the playlist already, or if the track only had one vote that got cancelled.
\item New track is playing:
    When a another track instance ended, due to being skipped or reached the end. This should affect the \textbf{vote} count of a \textbf{track}. If a \textbf{user}s track is played his vote should be neglected.
\item Adding/Removing restrictions:
    When the administrator either adds or removes a restriction for the system, this may also be by time intervals. Already added \textbf{track} that does not meet the requirements should be neglected. Cascading through the specific \textbf{users} \textbf{vote}, and the \textbf{playlist}.

The following event table is used to describe what classes are involved in the immediate events of the problem domain:
