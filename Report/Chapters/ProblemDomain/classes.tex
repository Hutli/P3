These are the candidates for classes, the system needs to keep track of:
\begin{description}
	\item[Track]
	
	Used for holding meta data eg. artist, duration
	\item[User]
	
	Used for information about the user eg. votes
	\item[Playlist]
	
	Used for keeping track of the votes and tracks
	\item[Restriction] 
	
	To allow limitation of the set of tracks that can be added to the playlist.
	\item[Venue]
	
	
\end{description}

In order for the user to be able to vote for a track, a uniform way of referencing tracks is needed. To achieve this, a catalogue is induced. The user can the browse for a desired track.
