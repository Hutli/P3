These are the candidates for classes the system needs to keep track of:
\begin{description}
    \item[Track]

    Used for storing meta data e.g. artist, duration
    \item[User]

    Used for information about the user e.g. votes
    \item[Vote]

    Which track a user voted for to be played, and when the vote was submitted
    \item[Playlist]

    Used for keeping track of the votes and tracks
    \item[Restriction]

    To allow limitation of the set of tracks that can be added to the playlist
    \item[Venue]

    To store information about the playlist and restrictions
    \item[History]
    To contain tracks that were played in the past
\end{description}
