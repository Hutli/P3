\subsubsection{Naming}
Naming a system is creative process, and therefore subjective. Methods for creative thinking were applied for finding the collective most subjectively fitting name for the system. First by a brainstorming session, resulting in a list of word related to music, democracy and social activities, the earlier analysis in state of the art contributed in supplying various buzzword and word endings, -ify.

This being a open source project, an emphasis on this fact were pleasing for the project group, with a good reasoning by the market for open source software becoming increasingly popular (source).

\subsubsection{Logo}
For designing the logo, ideas were drawn from the brainstorming session of trying a fitting name, balance is symbolised as the \enquote{Yinyang} \cref{fig:yinyang} symbol and the \enquote{next song} button from a radios interface \cref{fig:vlc} is symbolising the playlist aspect of the system.

An effort were made to fusion these to values, the green color is carried over from the logo of platform the system is developed upon \enquote{Spotify}.
