\chapter{Introduction}
John was having a good time at his favourite bar. He was enjoying a cool beverage and was in the mood for his favourite track, \enquote{Carry On My Wayward Son}. John went to the bartender to give his request, but when he got to the counter, there was a large queue, which he had to wait for. After John had waited for what felt like eternity the bartender finally walked towards him. John could give his request at last, he greeted the bartender with a passion and enthusiastically spoke his request. The bartender politely turned his request down, as it did not fit into the general theme the bar was going for.\\

There are several problems, which could have been avoided, with what happened to John.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item He had to stand and wait in line at the bar
	\item He had to go to the bar, potentially leaving his seat or company
	\item He had to bother the bartender with something which is not the bartender's primary function
	\item His time was wasted, as his request was denied
\end{enumerate}
This project seeks to eliminate all four of these problems by creating an innovative solution for requesting tracks in a bar context.
