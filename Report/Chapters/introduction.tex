\chapter{Introduction}
John was having a good time at his favourite bar. He was enjoying a cool beverage and was in the mood for his favourite song, "Carry On My Wayward Son". John went to the bartender to give his request, but when he got to the counter, there was a large queue, which he had to wait for. After John had waited for what felt like eternity the bartender finally walked towards him. John could give his request at last, he greeted the bartender with a passion and enthusiastically spoke his request. The bartender politely turned his request down, as it did not fit into the general theme the bar was going for.\\

There are several problems, which could have been avoided, with what happened to John. Firstly, he had to stand wait in line at the bar. Secondly, he had to bother the bartender with something which is not the bartender's primary function in the bar. Thirdly, his time was wasted as his request was ultimately denied, meaning a waste of both his and the bartender's time.
This project seeks to eliminate all three of these problems by creating an innovative solution for requesting songs in a bar context.\\

This project will be constructed using an iterative approach, since the problem of requesting songs in a smart way has a high uncertainty. Git will be used as a version control system, the report itself is made in \LaTeX\ and the software solution is created using C\#. Everything hosted on Github.
