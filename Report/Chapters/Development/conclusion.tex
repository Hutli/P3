Development conclusion:

1st iteration:

	Milestones:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Talk to bar and pubs about requirements of a music system for their venue.
		\item Communicate a request for a song from one device to another and play it.
		\item Basic datastructure.
	\end{itemize}

	We started out with a requirement of being about to count votes on specific songs to, but we went a little behind schedule due unforseen details about libspotify, so we simplyfied it to just communicating a one request.

2nd iteration:
	
	Milestones:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Talk to everyday users about requirements for music system.
		\item Come up with a product name
		\item Make technical vertical prototypes for smartphones.
		\item Democratic handling backend for the backend.
	\end{itemize}
