\section{Spotify Web API Abstraction}
\label{imp:spotify_web_api}
This section provides information on the structure of the classes that are build around Spotify Web API. It will describe the considerations and approaches that has been taken, when designing the architecture.

When using the Web API to search on Spotify, three different items can be found: Track, Album and Artist. These three items are all identified by a unique ID from Spotify, which is what is also used as the id for the item in this project. The user is always eventually looking for a track, but can not necessary always find the track directly via the title, but often via the artist by whom it was created or album on which the track is placed. This is though not a problem because Spotify implements this in their search endpoint. When searching for a track Spotify always return tracks, but it does not necessary only find tracks that are similar to the query, it also finds artists and albums from the query and show the tracks you are most likely looking for by or on these. Though users are always looking for at track the meta data for this track, and its artist and album, is still important. On this bases the structure shown in~\cref{fig:WebAPIUML} was created.

%\subsection{Lazy Searching}
%It was decided to have a minimal data download approach when designing the web API. This was done on the bases of the assumption that this API would most likely be the system used for searching for new tracks on the mobile front-end application. Since mobile phones still have limited data access, it is preferable for the user to use as little data as possible. This approach results in only three searches being done, one for each item type. Other requests are not done until other information about the item is needed. Furthermore this approach also results in all information being stored in the objects locally. It will be saved until the search object is removed, and the user hopefully has found his or her track.

%One search usually searches for all three different item types, track, album and artist, and present these to the user. Not all information about the artists and albums can be gathered from the json code received from these three initial searches. Albums does not have information about it tracks nor its artists initially, and an artist does not have information about its albums. The minimal data approach was therefore combined with another idea, data just in time. This was done since the user normally only wants information from one type of item, and not the two remaining types. It would therefore be undesirable for the user to wait, for all information for every item to be downloaded. This also fits very well with the minimal data approach since this minimize the amount of data requested, if the user does not look though all items in the search. The information not received from the initial searches, is therefore only requested from Spotify when the get method for the properties on items are called. To keep faithful to the minimal data approach this information is cached to the application and saved in the object structure so that the data does not have to be downloaded again.
