\section{White- and Black-list}

An obvoius implementation of these concepts is to white- and black-list specific tracks, this is a solution but to ease the process of making such extensive restriction, for the administrator, a possiblity of making more coarse restrictions would be beneficial. These restrictions is based on metadata related to the tracks, the artist of the track, the genre of the track or some signature tags. Spotify provides the artist and occasionaly the genre, the tags should be provided by another third party database of tags, like MusicBrainz. To ensure that the same track is found across both databases, an ISRC \footnote{International Standard Recording Code\cite{isrc}} is provided from Spotify database.
