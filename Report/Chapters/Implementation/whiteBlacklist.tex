\section{White- and Blacklist}

An obvious implementation of these\kanote{these?} concepts is to whitelist and blacklist specific tracks, this is a solution but to ease the process of making such extensive restriction, for the administrator, a possibility of making more coarse restrictions would be beneficial \kanote{Giver KEIN mening (fra "this is a..")}. These restrictions are based on metadata related to the tracks; the artist of the track, the genre of the track and some signature tags, like "fast pace" or "electronic". Spotify provides very limited metadata in their database of music, but does include the most significant ones such as, what album the track is on, the artists who made the track and occasionally the genre. The tags would be provided by a third party database of metadata, such as Musicbrainz. An implementation of another provider of metadata, was concluded to be outside of the scope of the project, as the general concept is available through Spotify. To ensure that the same track is found across both databases, an International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) is provided from Spotifyâ€™s database. This can be used to uniquely identifying a music track \cite{isrc}.

The restrictions are implemented as a list of predicates, that each individual track must meet in order to be added to the playlist. These predicates add to\kanote{add to?} evaluate the artists of the track, if a blacklisted artist occurs on the track, the track is discarded, before being added. When the user is searching for a track, it will be marked as \enquote{filteredOut} to explicitly state that the track was found, but is not allowed to be played at the specific venue. This is done in order to minimize any confusion during the search phase.
