\section{Duplicates in the music catalog - Similar tracks variable lenght}
\label{sub:duplicates}

Some tracks in the music catalogue might be "duplicates", while maybe variyng in lenght, the track might the lyrics and the music is quite similar or simply identical. One imediate partwise solution is to compare the IRSC of the track, if they match one could discard either one of them, shortest duration might by most desirable, in the context of a venue with many music request.

more optimisations is needed though.
