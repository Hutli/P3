\section{Similar Tracks with Variable Length}
\label{sub:duplicates}

Some tracks in the music catalogue might be similar, while maybe
varying in length, the lyrics and the music might be quite similar or simply identical. One solution is to compare the ISRC of the track, if they match, one could discard either one of them, shortest duration might be most desirable, in the context of a venue with many music requests.
