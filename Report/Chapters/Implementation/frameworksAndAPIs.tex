Spotify was choosen as the platform from which the system would aquire its music data, due to Spotify being a well established platform with alot of users and good service uptime. This system is also in use at 3/4 interviewed bars, although it is only allowed to use spotify as an publicly availible system in Sweden \cref{source}, this means the project group does not have to deal with licensing and a hosting of music data for the system.
