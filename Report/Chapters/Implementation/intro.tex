This part describes the implementation of the design presented in \cref{design}, providing some understanding for the reader of some decisions, and explain any deviations made from the originally designed concepts, due to implementational limits \chnote{maybe causes instead?}. In \cref{imp:general_practices} the general practices used throughout the implementation phase are outlined. \Cref{imp:spotify_web_api} explains the implementation of a library providing access to Spotify's Web API (See \cref{techPlat:music_catalog_web_api}). Additionally \cref{imp:libspotify} details the implementation of a library providing access to libspotify (see \cref{techPlat:music_catalog_libspotify}) through a C\# interface.
