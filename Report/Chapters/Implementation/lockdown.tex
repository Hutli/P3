\subsection{Lockdown}
When the server receive votes it changes the list of votes and users. These lists are used to select the next track and convert the temporary votes to permanent votes just before the next track is played. This could possibly conflict if a user changes his or her vote while these tasks are done by the server. It was therefore decided that a lockdown must be placed 10 seconds before the next track is played, where no user can change their vote.
