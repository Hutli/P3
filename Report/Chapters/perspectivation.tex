\chapter{Insights}
\label{cha:perspectivation}

Through the process of creating a social music application, the authors have been exposed to several learning experiences. This project has given experience in modelling and analysing requirements within the object oriented paradigm, while structuring the classes of the problem domain in \cref{problemDomain}.
While developing the solution, knowledge about different design patterns were obtained. These are some of the patterns that were used in the development process of the software solution: Singleton, MVVM and Dependency Injection. These patterns are described in \cref{designPattern}. 
Furthermore, the authors learned about systematic testing and evaluation of the user interface, using unit tests and usability testing, as described in \cref{unitTesting} and \cref{sub:usability}.
